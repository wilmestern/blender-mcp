BlenderMCP connects Blender to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Blender. This integration enables prompt assisted 3D modeling, scene creation, and manipulation.

## Current version(1.5.5)
- Added Hunyuan3D support
- View screenshots for Blender viewport to better understand the scene
- Search and download Sketchfab models
- Support for Poly Haven assets through their API
- Support to generate 3D models using Hyper3D Rodin
- Run Blender MCP on a remote host
- Telemetry for tools executed (completely anonymous)

### Installating a new version (existing users)
- For newcomers, you can go straight to Installation. For existing users, see the points below
- Download the latest addon.py file and replace the older one, then add it to Blender
- Delete the MCP server from Claude and add it back again, and you should be good to go!


## Features

- **Two-way communication**: Connect Claude AI to Blender through a socket-based server
- **Object manipulation**: Create, modify, and delete 3D objects in Blender
- **Material control**: Apply and modify materials and colors
- **Scene inspection**: Get detailed information about the current Blender scene
- **Code execution**: Run arbitrary Python code in Blender from Claude

## Components

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Blender Addon (`addon.py`)**: A Blender addon that creates a socket server within Blender to receive and execute commands
2. **MCP Server (`src/blender_mcp/server.py`)**: A Python server that implements the Model Context Protocol and connects to the Blender addon

## Installation


### Prerequisites

- Blender 3.0 or newer
- Python 3.10 or newer
- uv package manager: 

**If you're on Mac, please install uv as**
```bash
brew install uv
```
**On Windows**
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex" 
```
and then add uv to the user path in Windows (you may need to restart Claude Desktop after):
```powershell
$localBin = "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin"
$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$userPath;$localBin", "User")
```

Otherwise installation instructions are on their website: [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

**⚠️ Do not proceed before installing UV**

> **Personal note:** On Windows I also had to restart my machine (not just Claude Desktop) before the `uv` command was recognized in the terminal. If you get a "command not found" error after following the steps above, try a full reboot.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the Blend
